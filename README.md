Hello everyone! I've just launched my personal website, where you can find more about me at  [My Personal Web](https://cn-personal-web.glitch.me/)

On my website, you'll discover my educational background, work experiences, and a portfolio of projects. 

The website utilizes responsive design, optimizing demonstrations for devices of different sizes through media queries in conjunction with grid/flex layouts.

I'm deeply passionate about web / app development and I showcase my skills and expertise through my projects. I also hold several certifications that validate my professional abilities and learning achievements.
Feel free to visit my personal website to learn more about me, and let's connect on LinkedIn! I look forward to sharing experiences and exchanging ideas with you.
